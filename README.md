Introduction
The idea of this notebook is to explore a step-by-step approach to create a K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm without the help of any third party library. In practice, this Algorithm should be useful enough for us to classify our data whenever we have already made clusters (in this case color) which will serve as a starting point to find neighbors.
