In practice, this Algorithm should be useful enough for us to classify our data whenever we have already made clusters (in this case color) which will serve as a starting point to find neighbors.\r\n\r\n```R\r\n# Data to learn\r\nlibrary(readr)\r\nRGB <- as.data.frame(read_csv(\"RGB.csv\"))\r\nRGB$x <- as.numeric(RGB$x)\r\nRGB$y <- as.numeric(RGB$y)\r\nprint(\"Working data ready\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 1.1 Train and test sample generation\r\n\r\nWe will create 2 different sample sets:\r\n\r\n- <b>Training Set:</b> This will contain 75% of our working data, selected randomly. This set will be used to train our model.\r\n- <b>Test Set:</b> Remaining 25% of our working data, which will be used to test the accuracy of our model. In other words, once our predictions of this 25% are made, will check the \"<i>percentage of correct classifications</i>\" by comparing predictions versus real values.\r\n\r\n```R\r\n# Training Dataset\r\nsmp_siz = floor(0.75*nrow(RGB))\r\ntrain_ind = sample(seq_len(nrow(RGB)),size = smp_siz)\r\ntrain =RGB[train_ind,]\r\n\r\n# Test Dataset\r\ntest=RGB[-train_ind,]\r\nOriginalTest <- test\r\npaste(\"Training and test sets done\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
